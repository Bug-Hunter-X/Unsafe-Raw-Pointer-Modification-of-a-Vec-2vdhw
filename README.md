This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: directly modifying a vector's elements via a raw pointer.  While seemingly efficient, it breaks Rust's ownership model and leads to undefined behavior. The `bug.rs` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` presents a safer alternative using standard Rust methods.  This example highlights the importance of adhering to Rust's safety mechanisms.
